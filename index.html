          Stepping outside your comfort zone seriously improves your life.
          Humans have an evolutionary need to be challenged—to feel discomfort.
          That’s the main revelation of journalist Michael Easter’s The Comfort
          Crisis, a book about embracing discomfort to “reclaim your wild,
          happy, healthy self.” Through his research, Easter discovered that
          living outside of our comfort zone is good for us, dramatically
          improving both our health and happiness. We may not enjoy whatever
          discomfort we expose ourselves to in the moment—be it a physical,
          mental, or spiritual hardship—but doing so is key to personal growth
          and even just plain contentment. However, if we’re to take that first
          step outside of our comfort zone, we have to get comfortable with
          being uncomfortable. And we can’t do that unless we master the
          internal triggers that tend to make us run back to the safety of
          comfort.

          Compared to ages past, today’s world is a bona fide utopia for most
          people living in the industrialized world. Everything we need, and
          much we don’t need, is at our fingertips: food, soft beds,
          temperature-controlled shelter. We live in stark contrast to how our
          ancestors lived for thousands of years, enduring in extreme conditions
          and hunting and gathering just enough food to survive. Those thousands
          of years of struggle imbued us with evolutionary traits that helped us
          to survive then—but, as Easter argues, make us ill suited for the
          world of comfort that’s come to be over the past 100 years. As I write
          in my book Indistractable, humans are wired to escape pain and thus
          seek comfort. Through human history, this trait helped us to survive,
          pushing us to escape cold, stress, and hunger by constantly pursuing
          warmth, safety, and food. Yet our instinct to default to comfort works
          against us in a largely comfortable world, Easter points out. It
          causes us to miss out on profound human experiences.
